# Solar System - Halley's Comet Perspective

A 3D visualization of our solar system from Halley's Comet's perspective, created using Three.js. The simulation compresses the comet's ~76-year orbit into an 80-second visualization, allowing viewers to experience the journey of this famous celestial object through our solar system.

## Features

- Real-time 3D visualization of the solar system
- Perspective view from Halley's Comet
- Cel-shaded rendering for artistic visualization
- Accurate planetary textures
- Time-compressed orbital simulation
- Mobile-friendly and cross-browser compatible
- Responsive design

## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- WebGL for hardware acceleration
- ES6 Modules for code organization
- CDN delivery for optimal performance

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. No build process required - files can be served directly
3. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser

## Usage

The visualization automatically starts when the page loads, showing:
- The sun with realistic lighting
- All major planets with accurate textures
- Halley's Comet's perspective as it travels through the solar system
- Compressed time scale (80 seconds per orbit instead of 76 years)
